# sensor-fault-detection

This is the implementation of the sensor fault framework presented in 
Taking care of our drinking water: Dealing with Sensor Faults in Water Distribution Networks,
Vaquet V, Artelt A, Brinkrolf J, Hammer B,
31st International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, Bristol.

It consists of
